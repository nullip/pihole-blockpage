# Pi-Hole Custom Block Page
### Now with more clicky buttons!

Make sure to replace the {REPLACEME} values in  the index.html with your API Keys from your pi.hole install.

Rather rough implementation as it opens extra tabs for the api hits but a good proof of concept (and subsequently good enough for my home usage).

**Not intended for external network usage (as the API key will be viewable by anyone on your DNS).
